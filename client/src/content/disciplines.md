#Core Disciplines

##Advanced Finite Element Simulations

We apply State of the Art finite element proprietay codes to perfrom nonlinear, transient analyses of 2D and 3D structures. Our core codes are described below.

##Performance Based Earthquake Engineering

##Probabilistic and Statistical analyses

##Concrete Deterioration

##Complex Laboratory Testing
