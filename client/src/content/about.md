##A little bit about us.
<br>
X-Elastica is a small consulting firm, based in Boulder CO, focusing on the nonlinear analysis of complex concrete and reinforced concrete structures through advanced non-linear analyses.
We specialize in AAR, seismic analysis, probabilistic based failure analyses and related matters.

Focus areas include: concrete dams, nuclear containment structures, bridges, and buildings.

We use in-house developed software (developed and fine-tuned over a cumulative ~50 years) to perform state of the art analysis when all else failed to provide satisfactory results.

Our company has its root in academia, our tools have been extensively reviewed through peer-reviewed articles in top journals, our focus is exclusively on complex problems that can not be addressed with commercial codes.

##Leaders
<br>
###Dr. Victor Saouma
<br>
is a full professor at the University of Colorado in Boulder and specializes in the probabilisitc based nonlinear safety assessment (ageing and seismic) of concrete dams and nuclear containment structures. As a faculty he has taught a battery of structural analysis courses (introductory, matrix analysis, finite element, nonlinear analysis of frames) as well as fracture mechanics and continuum mechanics (at the EPFL). His research has focused on theoretical, numerical and experimental aspects of infrastructure safety assessments. It has been funded by: National Science Foundation, US Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. His academic web page can be found <a href='http://civil.colorado.edu/~saouma/'>here.</a>

<br>
###Dr. Jan Červenka
<br>
is the executive director at <a href='http://www.cervenka.cz/'>Červenka Consulting</a>, and has a strong research as well as practical oriented experience in application of advanced simulation technology in engineering problems such as: advanced numerical modeling of brittle and heterogeneous materials, simulation of engineering structures, grid/cloud/parallel computing of engineering problems, modeling of smart/intelligent structures/buildings. His professional goal is to strive for new development in these methods and bring them closer to practicing engineers and to extend the applicability of these modern methods in engineering practice.

A selection of recent consulting projects involving application of advanced engineering simulation in practice:

<br>
>• Design of jacket foundation connections of offshore wind farm using advanced fracture mechanics based nonlinear analysis, Hochtief, Germany
<br>
<br>
>• Verification of nuclear containment strength by non-linear analysis, Okiluoto 3 NPP, AREVA, Finland
<br>
<br>
>• Modeling and analysis of fiber-reinforced concrete tunnel lining for design of Ejpovice railway tunnel, Czech Republic
<br>
<br>

###Dr. Mohammadamin Hariri-ardebili
<br>
is a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at the Department of Civil Engineering, University of Colorado, Boulder. His main research interests are performance-based earthquake assessment of major structures (concrete dams, nuclear containment structures, and towers), coupled systems mechanics, mathematical modeling and life prediction of alkali-silica reaction. He has a great experience in modeling and simulation of engineering structures with strong academic background. Since 2011 he published more than 50 peer-reviewed journal papers. He taught the Earthquake Engineering course and regulary serves as reviewer/referee for more than 50 international journals and has been awarded by Elsevier as outstanding reviewer in 2016.
