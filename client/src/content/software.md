>###What is ATENA
***

ATENA (Advanced Tool for Engineering Nonlinear Analysis) is a user friendly software for nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures.
With ATENA one can simulate real behavior of concrete and reinforced concrete structures including concrete cracking, crushing and reinforcement yielding. ATENA gives the power to check and verify your structural design in a user friendly graphical environment.


The software has been extensively validated by winning predictions in various international benchmark competitions (such as you can see <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bukiQWx3E4I'></a>)


It is used at more than 1000 installations worldwide.


>###Why use ATENA
>• It is to be used mostly for complex structures where considerations go beyond mere design codes.


>• ATENA is for engineers interested in an in-depth understanding of the real structural behavior.


>• ATENA is the perfect tool to assess reinforcement details in critical sections whose analysis may be problematic to other codes.


>• The inherent nonlinear approach triggers internal force redistribution due to cracking; this may result in reinforcement savings.


>• It helps to discover additional load carrying capacity.


>• State of the Art tool used also by many researchers investigating the complex response of reinforced concrete structures or modern cementitious materials.

>###Why is ATENA Unique
>>###Modeling of Reinforcement
Arbitrary reinforcement arrangement can be easily included in the model either as discrete bars or as smeared reinforcement. Bond failure can be activated just by single click. Pre-stressing and external cables are supported as well.

>>###Real Time Visualization of Results
Only in ATENA the engineers can observe the deformation shape and the cracking pattern even during analysis using the unique and extensive runtime visualization capabilities.

>>###Crack Visualization
ATENA supports realistic visualization of cracks and cracking pattern in all stages of the nonlinear analysis a post-processing. Cracks can be displayed not only on the surface, but also in the interior. For more realistic visualization, only the visible cracks can be filtered.

>###Maintenance and Support
We strongly support our users in their analytic work with ATENA. Support is mainly provided by email and phone calls. The solution to many questions can be found also in our FAQ & Online Forum. New versions of ATENA are released every year. Maintenance is provided for free for one year after the software purchase. After that it can be prolonged at annual rate corresponding to 15% of the program price.

<h3 id='merlin'>Merlin</h3>
>Merlin is a proprietary specialized 3D nonlinear/transient finite element software which has been under continuous development by Saouma''s group to specifically address problems associated with: fracture and deterioration of concrete, safety assessment of dams and nuclear containment structure.


Development was made possible in great part through initial funding from the Electric Power Research Institute (<a href='https://www.epri.com/#/'>EPRI</a>) and then the Tokyo Electric Power Service Company (<a href='http://www.tepsco.co.jp/english/company/about/index.html'>TEPSCO</a>).
